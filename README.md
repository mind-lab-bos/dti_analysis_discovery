# dti-analysis-discovery
Scripts used for DTI analysis on Discovery Cluster. Includes scripts for bedpostx, probtractx2, and extracting FA/other scalar values

# Initial steps:
  First, make sure you have account on Discovery Cluster. Go to https://northeastern.service-now.com/research?id=nurc_category and click on "Research Computing Access Request" to request an account, specifying Psyche Loui as the University Sponsor. This may take a few days/a week.
  https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/TBSS/UserGuide : This guide has all the information needed to preprocess and run other commands like bedpostx and probtractx. Read it in the meantime to familiarize yourself with all the commands, don't worry if it's overwhelming! The main thing to understand is knowing which commands to run in which order, and ensuring that your DTI data is in the specified format needed for each command.
